The simulation of gas particles in a container
  by using Leonard-Jones potential equations.

TODO:
    * Number crunching in C++
    * Implement Runge-Kutta algorithm
    * Implement Walls to the container
    * Show how macroscopic properties of the gas are
      changing during the simulated time period.
    * Visualize everything using Python
